As even google and git projects started with sloppy code - it would be a mistake to judge this code by completeness and perfection. What makes the product great - is a continuous team effort. With this in mind please have a look at the simple Mars Rover emulator.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Some choices about the project structure are opionated and would have a different setup for a production app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci`

Restores the node_modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test -- --watchAll=false --coverage`

Launches the test runner <br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
